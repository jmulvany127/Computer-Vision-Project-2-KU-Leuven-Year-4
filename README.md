## Computer-Vision-Project-2-KU-Leuven-Year-4
This Project consisted of the Three Main Parts

Image classification:
Here an end-to-end convolutional neural network was trained to classify a images as one of 20 classes

Semantic segmentation:
The same was done in section 2 , however for semantic segmantation instead of simply image classification

Adversarial attacks:
Finally we launched an adversarial attack on our image classification model with the goal of erturb test images in a way that
they look unperturbed to humans but the CNN classifies these images in line with the perturbations.

Again the Project was initially completed as part of a Kaggle competetion and as such Kaggle version control was originally used. Final product has been migrated to git hub
